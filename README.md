## What am I trying to do?
An extension that aids in link selection(links can be small and cluttered) by highlighting all the links around a certain region of the mouse and lets the user select which link, based on some selection mechanism(currently keyboard, can be:  eye blinks, capacitive touch, etc).

Can be used with **mouse-to-joystick** concept ([Now located here! It's a thing!](https://github.com/RohanGautam/JoystickMouse)) for more ease of use for users for whom fine mouse control can be an obstacle (due to hand problems like capel syndrome).

## Prototype screenshots
* Using keyboard numpad to navigate into/click links in a given region:
