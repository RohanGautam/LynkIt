# LynkIt
## What am I trying to do?
An extension that aids in link selection(links can be small and cluttered) by highlighting all the links around a certain region of the mouse(via a popup maybe?) and lets the user select which link, based on some selection mechanism(currently undecided - eye blinks, cpacitive touch, etc).

Might be used with mouse-to-joystick concept or standalone.
